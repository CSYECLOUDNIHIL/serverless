# AWS Lambda Function - File Uploader

This AWS Lambda function is designed to handle file uploads to Google Cloud Storage triggered by AWS SNS messages. It includes error handling, DynamoDB logging, and email notifications via Mailgun.

## Setup

1. **Environment Variables:**
   Make sure to set up the necessary environment variables in the AWS Lambda environment for the following:

   - `REGION`: AWS region.
   - `MAIL_GUN_API_KEY`: API key for Mailgun.
   - `MAIL_GUN_DOMAIN`: Mailgun domain.
   - `AWS_DYNAMODB_TABLE`: DynamoDB table name.
   - `GCP_BUCKET`: Google Cloud Storage bucket name.
   - `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Base64-encoded Google Cloud service account key.

2. **Dependencies:**
   Install the required Node.js dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Functionality

- The Lambda function is triggered by AWS SNS messages.
- It fetches file data from the provided URL and uploads it to Google Cloud Storage.
- DynamoDB is used for logging the status of the file upload.
- Email notifications are sent via Mailgun based on the success or failure of the file upload.

## Lambda Execution Role

Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary permissions to:

- Read from AWS SNS.
- Write to Google Cloud Storage.
- Write to DynamoDB.
- Send emails via Mailgun.
